# Remote Access Trojan (RAT)

Remote Access Trojan is a lightweight Remote Access Tool (RAT) built in Python, enabling command-and-control communication between a client and a server over a TCP connection. It allows secure, remote file access, shell command execution, directory browsing, system information retrieval, screenshots, and more. This project is for **educational and authorized use only**.

üõ°Ô∏è Defense & Detection
To protect against Remote Access Trojans like this one, consider the following practices:

Antivirus & Endpoint Detection: Use modern antivirus software and EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response) tools that detect suspicious behavior like reverse shells or file exfiltration.

Firewall Rules: Restrict outbound connections and monitor traffic for unusual IPs or ports.

User Awareness: Educate users to avoid running unknown .exe files or Python scripts, especially those from email attachments or downloads.

Process Monitoring: Look for hidden or suspicious processes (e.g., Python scripts running in background with no GUI).

Network Monitoring: Set up IDS/IPS systems to flag unusual or unauthorized TCP connections from internal hosts.

Software Restriction Policies: Block script interpreters (e.g., Python) in non-dev environments using Group Policy or AppLocker.

Email Filtering & Sandboxing: Detect and quarantine potential malware before it reaches the user.
