# Remote Access Trojan (RAT)

Remote Access Trojan is a lightweight **Remote Access Tool (RAT)** built in Python, enabling command-and-control communication between a client and a server over a TCP connection. It allows secure remote file access, shell command execution, directory browsing, system information retrieval, screenshot capture, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 **Directory Listing** — Remotely list files in the target directory.
- 💻 **Shell Access** — Execute shell commands remotely, with directory change support.
- 📤 **File Download** — Download files from the client to the server.
- 📥 **File Upload** — Upload files to the client machine.
- ❌ **File Deletion** — Delete unwanted files remotely.
- 🖥️ **Screenshot Capture** — Take real-time screenshots of the client’s desktop.
- 🧠 **System Info** — Get platform, user, hostname, and working directory.
- 🔒 **Stealth Mode** — Fails silently if the server isn't available.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** — Cross-platform scripting and automation.
- **Sockets** — For TCP client-server communication.
- **Subprocess & OS** — Shell interaction and file system operations.
- **PyAutoGUI** — Capture client screenshots.

## 📦 Installation

---

### Clone the repository:
bash
```
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Remote-Access-Trojan.git
cd Remote-Access-Trojan
```
Create EXE
```
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile client.py
```
💡 Use --noconsole to hide the command prompt (on Windows only).
Make sure PyInstaller is installed:
pip install pyinstaller

If missing modules run the following:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# or run the following:

pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage
Server:
You’ll need a separate server implementation that listens for connections and issues commands like LIST_DIR, GET_INFO, SHELL, etc.

This repo currently focuses on the client.

Client:
You can run the client in two ways:

Run via Python:

```
python client.py
```
Run compiled executable:
```
./client.exe
```
Once launched, the client connects to the specified server IP/port and waits for incoming commands.

## 🛡️ Defense & Detection
To protect systems from RATs like this, follow cybersecurity best practices:

Antivirus & EDR — Use up-to-date security tools to detect behavior like reverse shells and file exfiltration.

Firewall Rules — Block suspicious outbound traffic and restrict high-risk ports.

User Awareness — Train users not to run unknown .exe or .py files.

Process Monitoring — Watch for hidden background scripts with no UI.

Network Monitoring — Set up IDS/IPS to detect unauthorized TCP connections.

Script Blocking — Use AppLocker or Group Policy to block interpreters like Python on non-dev machines.

Email Filtering — Sandboxing and attachment scanning help stop malware at the gate.
